Portfolio/Resume site for Leigh Stein. A place to show off my work to use in finding jobs for the future.

Uses JQuery and Bootstrap.

Things to add in the future:
 - Previous and Next arrows for the lightboxes in portfolio.
 - Add captions to display in lightbox
 - Dynamically generate portfolio images with ajax/js.
 - Make contact form functional

 - Do something fancier with the main menu
 - Design a logo/branding image for the header

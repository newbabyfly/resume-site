Portfolio/Resume site for Leigh Stein. A place to show off my work to use in finding jobs for the future. Will likely be completely redesigned for actual job-hunting.

To view, run index.html  OR go to http://schism.org/portfolio
Uses JQuery and Bootstrap.

BUG: Find lightbox solution
- Squishes thumbnails in IE
- Squishes full-sized images in Chrome

Both work fine in Firefox. Either thumbnail proportion css hack or the lightbox scipt in use is not cross-broswer compatible, maybe both. :/


To do List:
 - Previous and Next arrows for the lightboxes in portfolio.
 - Add captions to display in lightbox
 - Make contact form functional
 - fancy up the main navigation?
 - fix background overlay on portfolio page in mobile/tablet mode
 - carousel is meh. Restyle or find a different presentation method


Longterm goals:
 - Dynamically generate portfolio images with ajax/js, or with a database
 - Templating system for this and future projects?
 - Create actual branding logo
